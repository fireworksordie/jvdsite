<h1>Who is John Van Deusen</h1>

John's a sweet dude. He grew up in Anacortes, WA and started playing in bands. Back then he had a whopping mop of curly hair and played some emo keyboard music. It was already pretty good. Like you could tell he was getting somewhere.<br/><br/>
With some buddies from Anacortes he started The Lonely Forest and ended up making a couple albums with them after winning a Battle of the Bands thing. Then Chris Walla signed them to his new label and they made another couple albums. They toured the country in a van, played on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (good luck finding that clip online), and eventually called it quits (well, hiatus, but you know how those things go. maybe someday?).<br/><br/>
After taking a few years, John started releasing solo albums. He's still doing that now! Like literally *right now*. He's released 3 albums as part of the "(I Am) Origami" project and is about to release the 4th and final one. I've heard it. It's good! Trust me.<br/><br/>
